Results

My target and feature variable for this assignment was the "IS Successful" column. Two of the variables that were neither targets nor features and were removed from the data were the "EIN" and "Name' columns. I selected 2 layers with one having 8 neurons and the other having 5. I based this originally off of the homework but didn't have a chance to play with it how I wanted too. I was not able to achieve the target model performance.
